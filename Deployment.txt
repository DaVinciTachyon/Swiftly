The directons to install and run the backend
on a linux disto are contained in the README.md

To intall and run the Frontend side of the app
on windows download and install node.js, available at
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Once node.js has been installed then add npm to the
PATH environment variable.
Search 'edit environment variables for your account'

'Path' then click the edit button
On the box that appears click 'new' and add
'C:\Program Files\nodejs' before pressing ok on both

in your defaut browser, the app can then be launched
on your android phone by downloading the expo app and
scanning the QR code on screen.

NOTE: the computer running the backend and the phone running
the app must be on the same wifi network and the ip constant
on line 16 in Swiftly/Frontend/loginScreen.js must be 
changed to the IPV4 address of the backend computer (which
can be found by running 'ipconfig' in a terminal.
the port should remain '8000'
example ipAndPort 'my.backend.ip.address:8000'
