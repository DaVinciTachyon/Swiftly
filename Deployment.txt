# Back End
The backend contains three scripts:

1. The 'install' script can be run on Ubuntu and any other distros of linux with the apt-get package manager. When it is run, it installs all of the packages required for the backed api to run.
2. The 'startDatabase' script can be run on linux. When it is run it allows the creation of a fresh database as well as the creation of a superuser for the backend.
3. The 'runserver' script runs the backend code. It uses the server it is run on, to allow anyone to access its functions.

# Front End
To intall and run the Frontend side of the app
on windows download and install node.js, available at
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Once node.js has been installed then add npm to the
PATH environment variable.
Search 'edit environment variables for your account'
in the box labeled 'user variables for <USER>' select
'Path' then click the edit button
On the box that appears click 'new' and add
'C:\Program Files\nodejs' before pressing ok on both
boxes.
install expo by running 'npm install -g expo-cli'
in the command prompt.

Clicking on the start.bat file should now launch expo
in your defaut browser, the app can then be launched
on your android phone by downloading the expo app and
scanning the QR code on screen.
If clicking on the start.bat does not work, in the command prompt
enter 'cd path\to\Swiftly\Fontend'
      'npm start'

NOTE: the computer running the backend and the phone running
the app must be on the same wifi network and the ip constant
on line 16 in Swiftly/Frontend/loginScreen.js must be 
changed to the IPV4 address of the backend computer (which
can be found by running 'ipconfig' in a terminal.
the port should remain '8000'
example ipAndPort 'my.backend.ip.address:8000'
