# Front End

# Back End

The backend contains three scripts:
1. The 'install' script can be run on Ubuntu and any other distros of linux with the apt-get package manager. When it is run, it installs all of the packages required for the backed api to run.
2. The 'startDatabase' script can be run on linux. When it is run it allows the creation of a fresh database as well as the creation of a superuser for the backend.
3. The 'runserver' script runs the backend code. It uses the server it is run on, to allow anyone to access its functions.
